# Random Quote Generator

\nThis project fetches the quotes from an API, and puts them in State.

\nuseEffect is used initially to update the quotes array state and the random quote object state.

\nA button click updates the random quote object state.

\nA Twitter button automatically sends the quote to your Twitter account to be posted. (If it doesn't work, make sure your addblockers are off.)

\nTechnologies used:

\nReact: useState, useEffect
